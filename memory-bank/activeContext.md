# StoryForge Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: Foundation Setup
**Active Task**: Task #1 - Setup Next.js Project with Child-Friendly UI Framework

**Current Phase**: Project Initialization and Infrastructure Setup
- Taskmaster-AI successfully configured with 15 strategic tasks
- PRD analyzed and inconsistencies documented
- Ready to begin development with Next.js foundation

### Recent Progress

#### Completed Milestones
- ✅ Project structure initialized with Taskmaster-AI
- ✅ Memory-bank architecture established
- ✅ PRD moved to proper location (.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt)
- ✅ Task dependencies mapped with proper prioritization
- ✅ Development workflow established with safety-first approach

#### Key Decisions Made
- **Technology Stack Confirmed**: Next.js + SQLite + Ollama + Stable Diffusion
- **Development Approach**: Local-first with potential cloud migration later
- **Safety Architecture**: Multi-layer filtering with parental controls as core requirement
- **Task Structure**: 15 tasks with clear dependencies, project setup as #1 priority

### Next Immediate Steps

#### Ready to Execute
1. **Initialize Next.js Application** with child-friendly UI framework selection
2. **Setup Project Structure** with components organized for age-appropriate design
3. **Configure Development Environment** with proper child safety considerations
4. **Establish Database Schema** planning for SQLite integration

#### Upcoming Dependencies
- Task #2: SQLite Database Integration (depends on Task #1)
- Task #3: Authentication and Parental Controls (depends on Tasks #1, #2)
- Task #6: Ollama Integration (depends on Tasks #1, #2)

### Active Considerations

#### Technical Decisions Pending
- **UI Framework Choice**: Need to select child-friendly React component library
- **Database Schema Design**: Planning for user data, stories, and safety logs
- **Local AI Model**: Specific children's literature model selection for Ollama
- **Image Generation Pipeline**: Stable Diffusion integration with safety filters

#### Safety Implementation Strategy
- Content filtering architecture needs detailed planning
- Parental control interface design requires user research
- COPPA compliance checklist needs legal consultation
- Age verification mechanisms need technical specification

### Development Priorities

#### Phase 1 Focus (Current)
- Establish solid technical foundation
- Implement core safety infrastructure
- Create basic child-friendly interface
- Set up local development environment

#### Risk Mitigation Active
- **Content Safety**: Planning multiple filtering layers from project start
- **Age Appropriateness**: Ensuring UI/UX decisions consider 7-16 age range
- **Performance**: Keeping classroom scalability (20-30 users) in mind
- **Compliance**: COPPA requirements informing all data handling decisions

### Context for Next Development Session

**Starting Point**: Begin with Task #1 - Next.js project initialization
**Key Constraint**: Every technical decision must prioritize child safety
**Success Measure**: Foundation that supports all 15 planned tasks without major refactoring
**Timeline Awareness**: This is a proof-of-concept with 8-month development timeline

The project is well-positioned to begin active development with clear priorities and comprehensive planning completed.
