# StoryForge Project Brief

## Foundation Document

**Project Name**: StoryForge - Interactive Adventure Creator

**Core Mission**: Create a proof-of-concept web platform that demonstrates AI-powered interactive storytelling specifically designed for children and teens (ages 7-16), with comprehensive safety measures and educational value.

## Primary Goals

### Technical Objectives
- Demonstrate technical feasibility of local AI models for child-safe story generation
- Validate integration of AI-powered content creation with robust safety filtering
- Prove scalability for classroom environments (20-30 simultaneous users)

### User Experience Goals
- Enable 90% of children (ages 7-16) to create stories independently
- Achieve zero inappropriate content incidents through multi-layer safety
- Deliver 95%+ parent satisfaction with safety features and educational value

### Business Objectives
- Build initial user base and gather feedback for future development
- Validate market interest in AI-powered educational storytelling tools
- Create foundation for potential educational technology partnerships

## Core Requirements

### Safety-First Approach
- COPPA compliance for users under 13
- Multi-layer content filtering (AI + human moderation)
- Parental controls and monitoring systems
- Age verification mechanisms
- No direct child-to-child messaging

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with server-side rendering and responsive design
- **Backend**: Built-in API routes with Node.js handlers
- **Database**: Local SQLite for development and testing
- **AI**: Ollama deployment with children's literature fine-tuned model
- **Images**: Stable Diffusion API with child-safe filtering

### Key Features
- Kid-friendly story creation with AI assistance
- Three story directions: Adventure, Mystery, Fantasy

- Parental approval systems
- Visual story planning with pictures

## Success Criteria

### Immediate (Proof of Concept)
- Platform handles classroom usage without safety incidents
- Children demonstrate improved storytelling skills
- Parents express confidence in safety measures
- Technical architecture proves scalable and maintainable

### Long-term Vision
- Foundation for comprehensive educational storytelling platform
- Potential integration with school curricula
- Expansion to mobile platforms with maintained safety standards
- Community features with robust moderation

## Project Scope

**In Scope**: Child-safe story creation, AI-assisted writing, parental controls, local deployment
**Out of Scope**: Commercial monetization, social networking features, adult content creation
